# About me

I'm a Senior @ Purdue University, graduating with a BS in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering in December, 2024.

I love working on rockets, fluid systems (cryo especially), and spinning up random software projects

I'm also a huge F1 fan, I play the drums & flute, and love to explore new places to eat! I also really like to read and hang out with friends.

I've had a number of super cool work experiences so far, including some Mechnical & Propulsion Engineering internships:
- [Raptor](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) @ SpaceX
- [Falcon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) @ SpaceX
- [Antares/MLV](https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/medium-launch-vehicle) @ Northrop Grumman
- [Targets](https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/target-vehicles) @ Northrop Grumman

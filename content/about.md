# Hi, I'm Rajan!

I'm just about to finish undergrad @ Purdue [AAE](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/academics/undergraduate), and am a cleared US Citizen excited to make humanity a multiplanetary species!

I love working on rockets and ground systems, designing fluid systems, and spinning up random software projects

I've been lucky enough to work on some pretty cool stuff so far, including during Mechnical & Propulsion Engineering internships I've had on [Falcon](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/) & [Raptor](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/) @ SpaceX, and [Antares/MLV](https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/medium-launch-vehicle), [GBSD](https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/sentinel) & [Targets](https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/target-vehicles) @ Northrop Grumman!

This site is a place for me to showcase my non-professional experiences - including [my involvement](@/projects/upper_plumbing.md) on [PSP Liquids](https://purdueseds.space/liquids/) (Purdue's student liquid rocketry team)
